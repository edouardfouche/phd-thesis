Data Mining – known as the process of extracting knowledge from massive data sets – leads to phenomenal impacts on our society, and now affects nearly every aspect of our lives: from the layout in our local grocery store to the ads and product recommendations we receive, the availability of treatments for common diseases, the prevention of crime, or the efficiency of industrial production processes.
However, Data Mining remains difficult when (1) data is high-dimensional, i.e., has many attributes, and when (2) data comes as a stream. While previous work addresses high-dimensional data sets and data streams to some extent, the intersection of both has received much less attention. Nevertheless, extracting knowledge in this setting is advantageous for many industrial applications: identifying patterns from high-dimensional data streams in real-time may lead to larger production volumes, or reduce operational costs. 
This dissertation bridges this gap by proposing new algorithms to estimate and monitor dependency. We show that our new methods help to mine patterns, such as outliers, more efficiently and effectively in high-dimensional data streams. We support our algorithmic contributions with theoretical guarantees, as well as extensive experiments against both synthetic and real-world use cases. Overall, this dissertation establishes fundamental tools for Data Mining, which help with many applications in the industry, e.g., anomaly detection, or predictive maintenance. To facilitate the application of our results and future research, we publicly release our implementations, experiments, and benchmark data via open-source platforms.
