 abstract = {Francis Galton's invention of correlation dates from late in the year 1888, and it arose when he recognized a common thread in three different scientific problems he was studying. Galton's own 1890 account of the moment of discovery is discussed and contrasted with Karl Pearson's widely known association of correlation with a retreat into a recess at Naworth Castle. The circumstances that led Galton to write the account are reviewed.},
